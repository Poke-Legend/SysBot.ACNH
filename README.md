## SysBot.ACNHOrders

SysBot.ACNHOrders is a fully automated, queue-based order bot designed to inject item orders directly onto your island's map. Players can queue their orders, pick them up, and leave, with all processes, including dodo fetching, gate opening and closing, and even Tom Nook's or Isabelle's morning announcements, being fully automated.

Additionally, this bot serves as an advanced tool for connection logging, item dropping, map refreshing, and restoring online sessions after network or online crashes/disconnects.
