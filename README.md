# Pokemon Legends Animal Crossing New Horizon Sysbot

## Features added to this fork:
- Server Banned System
- Broadcasting System
- Ping System
- MysteryOrder System
- Embeds System

## SysBot.ACNHOrders

Designed as a fully automated queue-based order bot that injects item orders directly onto your island's map and lets the player that queued pick them up, then leave. All dodo fetching, gate opening & closing, movement and dialoguing (including Tom Nook's or Isabelle's morning announcement progression) is automated.

Alternatively, you may use this as a fully automated connection, logging, advanced item dropping, and map refresh bot (among other things) that restores the online session after a network or online crash/disconnect.
